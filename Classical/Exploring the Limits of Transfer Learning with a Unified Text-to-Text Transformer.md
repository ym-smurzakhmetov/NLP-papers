# Exploring the Limits of Transfer Learning with a Unified Text-to-Text Transformer

T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer) is a state-of-the-art language model developed by Google Brain that achieved strong performance on a wide range of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including language generation, question answering, and text classification.


# Dataset
T5 was trained on a large-scale dataset called the C4 dataset, which contains approximately 750GB of text data from various sources such as web pages, books, and articles. This dataset is preprocessed to convert the raw text into a text-to-text format, where the model is trained to generate output text conditioned on input text.
