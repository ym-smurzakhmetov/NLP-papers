# Exploring the Limits of Transfer Learning with a Unified Text-to-Text Transformer

T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer) is a state-of-the-art language model developed by Google Brain that achieved strong performance on a wide range of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including language generation, question answering, and text classification.


# Dataset
T5 was trained on a large-scale dataset called the C4 dataset, which contains approximately 750GB of text data from various sources such as web pages, books, and articles. This dataset is preprocessed to convert the raw text into a text-to-text format, where the model is trained to generate output text conditioned on input text.

# Model
One of the key innovations of the T5 model is the use of a shared decoder-encoder architecture, which means that the same transformer model is used for both encoding the input sequence and decoding the output sequence. This enables the model to handle a wide range of NLP tasks, from classification to text generation, without requiring task-specific modifications.

Another innovation of the T5 model is the use of a prefix in the input sequence to specify the task to be performed. For example, a prefix of "translate English to German: " would indicate that the model should translate the following English text into German. This allows the T5 model to perform a wide range of tasks with a single model, simply by changing the prefix in the input sequence.
